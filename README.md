# Getting Started

The SmartPay API requires a registered SmartPay account to access.

## Daily Rate Limiting

At this time, resultsets are not rate limited but are monitored for excessive use. It is strongly recommended that systems which connect with the API do so asynchronously wherever possible (i.e. not in user real-time). Users who request at greater than reasonable frequency will be disabled to prevent performance degredation for other users.

## Current Verison
